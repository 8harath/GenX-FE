Who Has This Problem? 🤔
Let’s be real — VR in India is still a luxury. Most people are stuck choosing between overpriced, high-end VR systems or cheap, low-quality mobile VR headsets. We’re here to change that.

🎓 Students & Colleges
Imagine: A medical student practicing surgery or an engineering student exploring complex machines — all in VR. But with 38,000+ colleges in India, only a few have VR labs because high-end headsets are too expensive.
💡 The problem: High hardware costs, lack of standalone VR devices, and limited VR content for Indian education.

🎮 Gamers Who Want to Try VR
India boasts 450+ million gamers, yet VR gaming is nearly non-existent. Why? Because setting up VR (PC + headset) costs ₹1 lakh+, and standalone headsets like the Quest 3 start at ₹50,000.
💡 The problem: VR gaming is growing fast but remains out of reach for most players.

🏥 Doctors & Hospitals
VR is transforming medical training, letting doctors and nurses practice complex procedures without risk. But again, the cost of high-end VR hardware is a massive barrier.
💡 The problem: India’s healthcare VR market is growing at 22% CAGR, but hospitals can’t afford the tech.

🏭 Companies & Industrial Training
Big industries (manufacturing, automotive, IT) use VR to train employees efficiently. Yet, most Indian companies don’t have access to powerful VR hardware.
💡 The problem: The Indian AR/VR market will hit $14 billion by 2030 — but companies need affordable, high-performance VR solutions.

🚀 Indie Developers & Startups
India has 50,000+ indie game developers and several AR/VR startups. But they can’t afford high-end dev kits to create and test new content.
💡 The problem: Lack of affordable VR hardware is slowing innovation.

🌟 The Opportunity
VR in India has less than 1% penetration — the demand is there, but the affordability isn’t. Education, healthcare, gaming, and industrial training are waiting for a cost-effective, standalone VR solution.
💡 With government initiatives like Digital India & Skill India, the time for affordable VR is NOW.
